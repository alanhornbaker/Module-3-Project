# Module 3 Project: Password Generator

## User Story and Acceptance Criteria
User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Description
I went rogue on this one; after I cloned the starter code, I wasn't sure where or how to get started. 

I was wanting to access the lecture recordings to freshen up on some of the topics (arrays,functions, objects, etc) so I could build out the JS file, but I couldn't access the recordings on bootcampspot for some reason.

Option B was trying to find youtube lectures on JS, other examples, to then apply to the started code given on bootcampspot.  After starting the video, I liked the look and functionality of the other password generator a lot more. I decided to code along with the video as the JS file was written out, and since I was understanding what was going on in the video (and unable to access lecture videos), I decided to just make this my project and adjust later if possible.

The creator of this password generator is someone named Florin Pop.

The video I was coding along with is linked here:

    *I have referenced the sources and tried to give credit where it is due to the best of my abilities, and explicitly reference the only change I made to the code to make it "original".  Please do not interpret this as attempted plagiarism.

## Why I Went Rogue
I thought walking along with this video was useful for a couple reasons:
    A. I can't put my finger on it yet, but the way this guy develops a JS script feels a little different that the way Andre (our instructor) does.

    B. The way Florin writes this JS script seems to be very efficient.  There are a lot of instructions building a lot of functionality, but written in not that many lines of code.

    C. It was useful to see how the developer decomposed the project into parts:
        1. Generator Functions - writing generator functions to generate random password inputs
        2. Writing DOM elements, equivalent variables to be used by DOM elements
        3. Generate Password Function - passing the above into a password generation function that uses and         combines the above elements to generate an actual password.
        4.

## Current Problems with Application and Assignment
    1. There isn't much original code.  In the html, Line 47, I changed the title on the "Generate Password" button to "Generate Randomized Password". This is the only code original to Alan Hornbaker. 

    2. Even though I "co-coded" this JS file with the video 4-5 times, my application still doesn't actually generate a password.  There must be some bug in the JS file that was born when I was coding along with the video.

## Thoughts for Future Development and Feedback Request

Thoughts on Future Development:

I am constantly needing to generate new passwords for applications at work, and thought this application might be useful for those needs.  Additional features I might add are:
    1. the ability to use the application offline or outside of a web browser.
    2. the  ability store used passwords in a seperate location or sister application.
    3. other security features.


Feedback Request:

    In addition to the standard feedback you'll need to give me per class structure, could you also point me towards my bug?  I want to actually be able to use this thing, but I can't find the difference between my JS file and the one written in the video.  Thank you!
